        <h3 style="font-size: larger;  color: #f7f7f7;"> Synopsis</h3>
        <p> During their decade-long quest to defeat the Demon King, the members of the hero's party—Himmel himself, the
            priest Heiter, the dwarf warrior Eisen, and the elven mage Frieren—forge bonds through adventures and
            battles, creating unforgettable precious memories for most of them.

            However, the time that Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of her life,
            which has lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually
            returns to her "usual" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of
            time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.

            As the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her.
            Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence
            for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story
            of that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin.
