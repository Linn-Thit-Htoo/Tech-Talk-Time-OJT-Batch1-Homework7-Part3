                    Check out my evolving portfolio website - a masterpiece in progress (or maybe not). Brace yourself
                    for the whimsy of my design choices. From bold colors to the..... idk, who needs a set theme? It's
                    not about a clear plan; it's about embracing the chaos of the unknown. Welcome to a website that's a

                    <p>Behold the marvel of modern technology! Feast your eyes on a working calculator, powered by a
                        script so simple even a cat could understand it (well, maybe not). Feel free to crunch some
                        numbers and witness the magic of straightforward programming. It's not rocket science, but it
                        might just solve a few of life's equations. Happy calculating!

                        hero. And that back button? Aim for the arrow; the white space is just there to confuse you.
